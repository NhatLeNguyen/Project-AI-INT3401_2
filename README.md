# Nhom6_INT3401_2-AI
- Project 0: Python, Setup, & Autograder Tutorial
Instructions on how to set up Python,
Workflow examples,
A mini-Python tutorial,
Project grading: Every projectâ€™s release includes its autograder that you can run locally to debug. When you submit, the same autograder is ran.

- Project 1 (Pacman): Search
   Your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
   
- Project 2 (Pacman): Logic and Classical Planning
   You will use/write simple Python functions that generate logical sentences describing Pacman physics, aka pacphysics. Then you will use a SAT solver, pycosat, to solve the logical inference tasks associated with planning (generating action sequences to reach goal locations and eat all the dots), localization (finding oneself in a map, given a local sensor model), mapping (building the map from scratch), and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).
   
- Project 6: Machine Learning
  This project will be an introduction to machine learning; you will build a neural network to classify digits, and more!
